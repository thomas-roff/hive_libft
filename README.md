# libft
Libft Project for Hive, Helsinki

Libft is custom library with implementations of many functions common to standard C libraries. This code was written in 
spring 2025 at the start of my studies at Hive, Helsinki, a 42 School.

The code is intended for general use in other C projects later in the 42 School Curriculum. All standard library functions 
are prototyped according to manual entries on Linux. Other functions are according to the tasks set out by 42 School 
documentation.
